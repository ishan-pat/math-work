# 🧠 Personal Notes on Mathematical Optimization and Scientific Computing

Welcome! This is a curated collection of **handcrafted, theory-backed, performance-driven notes** I’ve written to deepen my understanding of advanced mathematical methods used in **quantitative research**, **scientific computing**, and **high-performance systems**.

These aren’t just study notes—they’re working documents, used to explore and implement techniques like:
- FFT-accelerated iterative solvers for Toeplitz systems  
- Preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) methods  
- Eigenvalue and SVD decomposition pipelines  
- Optimization theory, linear programming, and more  

### 📌 Why This Exists

> I built this repo as a personal reference and to showcase the kind of problems I enjoy solving—at the **intersection of mathematics, HPC, and systems engineering**. These notes also serve as **supporting materials** for my applications to roles in **quant finance**, **scientific infrastructure**, and **applied math research**.

You’ll find:
- 💻 **Code listings** (Python, Fortran, C++)  
- 📊 **Performance benchmarks** on CPU/GPU clusters  
- 🧮 **Mathematical derivations** and real-world modeling examples  
- ✅ Problems, sketches, and implementation ideas
